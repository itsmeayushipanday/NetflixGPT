I have made a login page which container a header with title netflix. Used relative absolute concept of css to make sure that netflix is visible.

then I had made a sign in sign up form. firslty I had mase a sign in form simply and then I have reused the same form and converted it into a sing up form using use state function help. made sure that if isSignInForm is true, then sign in form things occur else sign up form components occur.
